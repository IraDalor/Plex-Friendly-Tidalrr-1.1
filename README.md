  Tidalrr is a self-hosted service that lets you download music tracks from Tidal.<br/>
  It can be interfaced with Lidarr to sync Artists, Albums, Playlists, etc. using the Lidarr integration.<br/>
  Tidalrr can also sync your Tidal Playlists to Plex & Plexamp.

## Usage
I recommend that you run it using docker or docker-compose.
The image is available on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jacobroyquebec/tidalrr)
but I also provide an example of a docker-compose file.
Modify it and run `docker-compose up -d`

To use, watch the docker logs to capture the login URL and authenticate your tidalrr instance to Tidal.

## Developing
