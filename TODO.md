## Todo:
- migrate to SQLAlchemy to remove complexity
- replace the aigpy library
- create and sync Plex Playlist from Tidal Playlists
- Inject Tidal playlist into Spark by Devialet (using spark.py it can inject in the DB, but spark does not recognise/use it yet)
- local ai matching pattern
- more work on the Queues
    - scan files
    - matching table of playlist.uuid/track.id
- replace and select Masters albums/track
    - store matching information in db for future use (superseeded)
    - when scanning a track, look if it's album is superseeded, then scan the corresponding track
    - superseeded table? - for albums and tracks
- replace classes with functions as it's not needed and makes the code less readable
