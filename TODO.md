## Todo:
- migrate to SQLAlchemy to remove complexity
- replace the aigpy library
- create and sync Plex Playlist from Tidal Playlists
- Inject Tidal playlist into Spark by Devialet (using spark.py it can inject in the DB, but spark does not recognise/use it yet)
- local ai matching pattern
- more work on the Queues
    - scan files
    - if album's artist is not in db, add it queued=false
        - same for albums
- replace and select Masters albums/track
    - store matching information in db for future use (superseeded)
    - when scanning a track, look if it's album is superseeded, then scan the corresponding track
    - superseeded table? - for albums and tracks
- replace classes with functions as it's not needed and makes the code less readable
    - tidal.py
    - settings.py
    - model.py
- create an api webserver and control center
    - login into Tidal to catch token
    - add urls to the queue from tidal search or urls
    - list tidal playlists, artists, albums, tracks, mixes
        - download all
        - download selected
        - filter by state (online|downloaded|plex)
        - sync to plex
    - sync lidarr
        - interactive match with search
    -- sync user playlists
    - inject spark
    - maintenance
        - albums with master or max available to upgrade
        - incomplete albums, artists, playlists
        - missing covers
        - missing lyrics
        - migrate paths in queues and files
