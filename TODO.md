## Todo:
- migrate to SQLAlchemy to remove complexity
- replace the aigpy library
- create and sync Plex Playlist from Tidal Playlists (using PPP)
- Inject Tidal playlist into Spark by Devialet (using spark.py it can inject in the DB, but spark does not recognise/use it yet)
- local ai matching pattern
- more work on the Queues
    - scan files
- replace and select Masters albums/track
    - store matching information in db for future use (superseeded)
    - when scanning a track, look if it's album is superseeded, then scan the corresponding track
- replace classes with functions as it's not needed and makes the code less readable
    - tidal.py
    - settings.py
    - model.py
- create an api webserver and control center
    - start jobs
    - login into Tidal to catch token
    - add urls to the queue from tidal search, urls or files (replace cli)
    - have better templates
    - change settings
    - migrate paths in queues and files
- fix existing token import function
